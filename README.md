# Very Basic Robot to help new coders understand how command based programming works
A very simple example of a robot that will move motor 1 to a certain position when A is pressed, and will spin motor 2 while B is pressed.

Start off at src/main/include/Robot.h

This is an example of a timed robot, this is not what we will use but it is good to understand fundamentals, and it is also what we will use when we are prototyping and testing the robot.
